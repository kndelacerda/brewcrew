This is a web-applicated dedicated to recommending satisfactory bars for all members of a party. 

Things we need: 
- MADE IN REACT (Pls help, Amar)
- Calendar (Cronofy. Links to iCalendar, Google Calendar, etc.) for events
- SocketIO Messenger
- Voting functionality. After a bar has been recommended to an individual or group, the user(s) should be able to vote on the place. 
- Trending functionality. The app should give a tailored response to the users/group based off of their historical voting e.g. if a particular bar was heavily downvoted by a group, it will not be recommended again. 
- Login with Facebook. 
- Have user portfolios with a short questionarre on their preferences.
